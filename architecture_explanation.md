# System Architecture - Detailed Explanation

## Architecture Overview (8:30 - 9:30)
[Show comprehensive system architecture diagram with the following components]

Narrator: "Let's dive deep into how our AI Game Development Assistant works under the hood. The system is built with a robust, scalable architecture that ensures reliable performance and security."

## Backend Architecture (8:30 - 8:45)
[Show Flask backend components]
Narrator: "At its core, we have a Flask-based backend that handles:
- Secure API routing and request management
- Session handling and user authentication
- Rate limiting and request validation
- Error handling and logging
- Database operations for code history and user preferences"

## AI Integration Layer (8:45 - 9:00)
[Show AI model integration diagram]
Narrator: "The AI Integration Layer is where the magic happens:
- Gemini API integration for code understanding and generation
- Groq API for performance optimization and analysis
- Ollama integration for game-specific improvements
- Intelligent model selection based on task requirements
- Response aggregation and conflict resolution"

## Real-time Processing (9:00 - 9:15)
[Show real-time processing flow]
Narrator: "Our real-time processing system ensures instant feedback:
- Asynchronous task processing
- WebSocket connections for live updates
- Caching layer for frequently used responses
- Queue management for handling multiple requests
- Performance monitoring and optimization"

## Scalability Features (9:15 - 9:30)
[Show scalability components]
Narrator: "The system is designed to scale with your needs:
- Load balancing across multiple servers
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Resource optimization for large projects
- Caching strategies for improved performance
- Database sharding for large datasets"

## Security Measures
[Show security components]
Narrator: "Security is built into every layer:
- API key encryption and secure storage
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure WebSocket connections
- Regular security audits and updates"
